  <h2>Most Writers Stop Here</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; color: #a8a8a8; font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">
    Five weeks in, they drift back into writing alone—convincing themselves they’ll keep going.  
    But they don’t. They lose rhythm. They lose clarity. And they lose the heat they fought to build.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center; color: #fff; font-size: 1.3rem; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">
    You’ve already done the hard part: you showed up, you wrote, and you cared enough to keep coming back.  
    The worst thing you can do now is let that momentum die.
  </p>

  <ul class="problem-list">
    <li>Generic “coverage” that tells you what’s wrong but never how to fix it</li>
    <li>Guru formulas that drain the soul out of your story</li>
    <li>Endless rewrites with no accountability or progress</li>
    <li>Communities full of hobbyists instead of writers who finish shit</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align: center; color: #fff; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 3rem;">
    <strong>That’s where most writers stop.</strong><br>
    <span style="color: #dc2626;">That’s where The Writer’s Forge Pro begins.</span>
